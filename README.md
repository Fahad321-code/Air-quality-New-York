## 🧠 Insights

- **NO₂ and PM2.5 show a strong positive correlation** (r ≈ 0.9), indicating traffic-related emissions are a major driver of air pollution.
- **PM2.5 levels have decreased consistently** from ~12 µg/m³ in 2009 to ~6 µg/m³ by 2021—an improvement of ~50%.
- **Deaths due to PM2.5 pollution** have dropped by nearly 50% over the same period, from ~65 to ~33 per 100k people.
- **Boiler emissions (NOx)** also decreased around 2013–2015, aligning with NYC policy changes on heating fuels.
- Overall, the data shows that **NYC's air quality has significantly improved over the past decade**, leading to better public health outcomes.
- 📉 **Cleaner air = fewer hospital visits, lower mortality, and a healthier, more productive workforce.**
