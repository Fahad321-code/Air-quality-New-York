# 🌍 Air Quality Analysis: Impact on Health and Business

A complete Python data science project analyzing air pollution indicators in NYC, exploring correlations with health outcomes, and predicting particulate levels using machine learning.

## 📊 Key Features
- EDA with correlation matrix and regression plots
- Predictive ML model (Linear Regression)
- Focused insights on business & public health impact

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone/download this repo.
2. Open `Air_Quality_Analysis.py` or run it in Jupyter/Colab.
3. Required files: `Air_Quality.csv`

## 📈 Outputs
- `correlation_matrix.png`: Heatmap of pollution indicators
- `regression_pm25_no2.png`: Predicting PM2.5 from NO2

## 🧠 Insights
- NO2 and PM2.5 have strong positive correlation.
- Reducing NO2 (traffic) may reduce PM2.5 exposure.
- Cleaner air = healthier workers = better business outcomes.
